## About Typescript
- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds types.

- The type system refers to TypeScript’s understanding of how your code is meant to function: mainly what data types should be stored under your variables.
- xpects the data type of the variable to match the type of the value initially assigned to it at its declaration—this is known as type inference.
- An object’s shape describes, among other things, what properties and methods it does or doesn’t contain. TypeScript knows not only what type something is but also 
   what shape that type has.
- When it isn’t able to infer a type, TypeScript will consider a variable to be of type any.
- Type annotations are little pieces of code that indicate what type a variable is meant to be.

```typescript
let youAreAwesome: boolean;
youAreAwesome = true;
```
